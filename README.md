*Project Title:*
  Coach-Explorer
  
*Problem/Oppurtunity:*
  Formal education in schools would not always be possible, and even then, more practice, direction, and study materials might be needed. Schools can only help students so much; as a result, students may need coaching sessions to get a better understanding of themes in highly conceptual areas like Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics. This calls for the necessity for a platform where the students may interact with knowledgeable teachers.
  
The teachers who are running their business of teaching students may not have enough funds to be able to publicize and market their classes in a proper manner, thus a platform to be able to sell their class to students would be imperative.

Students might seek out a centralized location with information on all types of instructors, including their specialties, other qualifications, and a method of communication.


*Project Description:*
  The main motive behind the project is to be able to provide a platform for students enabling them to gain insights about teachers who have registered to the website with their details and areas of expertise (only Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics as of now). As the website includes a built-in feature to submit requests to these teachers, it is an extra benefit to be able to contact them without the teachers having to provide any sensitive personal information like their email addresses or phone numbers.
  
One of the main problems in today's world is the unawareness about presence of experienced and expert teachers in any required fields, and this web app aims at bridging this communication gap through provision of an interface for both the parties, the teachers and the students.

This web app, through it's various filters allows the user to find teachers for a specific subject like physics, chemistry or mathematics, or with multiple filters applied together. Low complexity of the website is the main benefit as it eases the navigability of the web app making it's usage more convenient for the user.

One can simply create an account on the Coach-Explorer website, after which they could register as a teacher. With any queries that one may have, they could use the request option, specifying their mail id, so that as soon as the teacher sees their request on their account, they're able to revert back through the mentioned email id, by just clicking on it.
